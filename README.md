# Cadabra

Cadabra (www.cadabra.co.in) is a website exclusively for Book readers where they can exchange, buy or sell their books. 
So a user would have his collection and another user would have his collection. So a request can me made for a book and the other person would pick a book from requesterâ€™s collection. 
Once the swap is agreed upon we carry out the exchange for them. There is another part where we you just sell the book, for a certain amount.
